Then, randomly split participants into 2 groups and let them interact with A and B respectively. After that, do two-sample hypothesis test with the experiment result. H0 is \"A and B have same efficacy\". We do a 1-tailed or 2-tailed test on this and see if p-value is in significant interval. If yes, we say that A and B have different efficacy."
